# ðŸŒžðŸŒž Array of Sunshine ðŸŒžðŸŒž

## ðŸŒž How to use

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bibicollins/array_of_sunshine.git
$ cd array_of_sunshine
$ npm install (requires node to be installed)
$ npm start (web app will open in the browser at localhost:3000)
```

### ðŸŒž Our objectives as a team

**1. Our project has a compelling technical aspect
2. That said, we do not sacrifice developer processes for technical achievement
3. We consolidate gaps in our learning from the course (we highlighted JSON API calls, client-side programming eg. React)
4. We prefer a simple and finished output to a complex and messy/unfinished output
5. We are all able to explain every aspect of the final product**

### ðŸŒž Our project

**Our aim is to provide a useful tool for beginner developers which provides the code needed to get from an input to an output, and which works for multiple programming languages.**

In other words:
- A single-page app, written in React
- Suggests methods to get from an input to an output, for example:
    1. User enters [a,b,c] as the input and [c,b,a] as the output
    2. Program returns `input.reverse` to the user
- Can  be used for a number of different programming languages

### ðŸŒž MVP
```
As a user
So that I can use the right array method in Ruby
I want to be able to input a simple initial array and a simple target array and be
given the method which gets me from one to the other
```
In practice this is:
- A web application written in React
- 10 array methods
- 1 language - Ruby

### ðŸŒž Potential future user stories

```
As a developer,
So that I can use this functionality when I'm coding
I want an extension to my text editor which suggests code for me

As a user
So that I can use the right array method in multiple languages
I want to be able to input initial and output arrays in eg. Ruby, Javascript, C++,
Python and Whitespace

As a user
So that I can learn about different languages
I want to be able to hover over methods and see information about the method

As a user
So that I can retain my learnings
I want to have an account and a search history

As a user
So that I can use the tool for more complex methods
I want to be able to use arrays which take arguments

As a user
So that I can use the tool for more complex methods
I want to be able to input other objects than arrays (multi-dimensional arrays,
hashes, strings)
```
### Todo
1. Stack info
2. Screenshot of the program in action
3. What we would have done with more time
4. Test coverage
5. ...
